# K-means Clustering and Spectral Clustering

This project is contributed by Zhaonan Meng, Alvedian Mauditra Aulia Matin, and Zuhair

## Description

This project is the homework of the TU Delft course 'Linear Algebra and Optimization for Machine Learning.' In this project, we studied a classical unsupervised learning algorithm: clustering. Various clustering algorithms were investigated based on a small data set, including K-means (standard Euclidean distance / kernelized distance) clustering and spectral clustering. Further outcomes of the project can be found in the PDF file 'project1.pdf' in this repository.
